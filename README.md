dataset.read_adv_stats()

dataset.read_team_adv_stats()
```

## üìä Available data

| Item | Description |
| :---- | :----------- |

| `kmeans_player` | Get the players clustering based on their advanced statistic and kmeans. |

 ## Method to load data
 
 Currently the libaray offers API to load data to postgresSQL, Google big query, Databricks Unity Catalog or to MS Fabric lakehouse:
 
 #### Create a dataset that is to be loaded with following parameters:
 
 year, big query project id, dataset id and table id

 ```python
 from BasketIntelligence.load_season_data import LoadSeasonData

 loader = LoadSeasonData("2025","gcp-project-id","BasketIntelligence")
```
 
 #### Load to big query:
 
 ##### Legacy method
```python
 loader.load_per_game_to_big_query("per_game_stats")
```

 ##### Dynamic method
```python
 loader.load_data(
        data_source='adv_stats',
        db_type='big_query',
        table_name='adv_stats'
    )
```
 
 #### Load to MS fabric lakehouse:
 
 ##### Legacy method
 ```python
 loader.load_adv_stats_to_lakehouse()
 ```

 ##### Dynamic method
```python
 loader.load_data(
        data_source='adv_stats',
        db_type='fabric_lakehouse',
        table_name='adv_stats'
    )
```

#### Load to Databricks Unity Catalog:
 
 ##### Dynamic method
```python
 #define the unity catalog and schema before loading
 spark.sql('USE CATALOG your-catalog-name')

 spark.sql('USE SCHEMA your-schema-name')

 loader.load_data(
        data_source='adv_stats',
        db_type='unity_catalog',
        table_name='adv_stats'
    )
```
